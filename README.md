# meeting-notes-manager
The Meeting Notes Manager is a web app designed to help users capture, organize, and retrieve meeting notes efficiently. Users can create, edit, search, and categorize their meeting notes, making it a valuable tool for both personal productivity and professional collaboration.

## Project Breakdown by Day
### Define Scope & Set Up Project

Goals:

    Clearly define the features and user flows for the Meeting Notes Manager.
    Establish the project structure and initialize the Go module with the necessary dependencies.

Tasks:

    Outline core features:
        Create, edit, and delete meeting notes.
        Categorize notes by meeting type or date.
        Search/filter notes by keywords.
        Optionally, add a tagging system.
    Sketch a rough UI wireframe (e.g., a dashboard with a list of notes, a detailed note view, and a search bar).
    Set up your project folder structure:

    /meeting-notes-manager
      â”œâ”€â”€ /templates        // HTML templates
      â”œâ”€â”€ /static           // CSS/JS files
      â”œâ”€â”€ main.go
      â”œâ”€â”€ routes.go
      â”œâ”€â”€ models.go
      â””â”€â”€ database.go

    Run go mod init meeting-notes-manager and install dependencies (Gin, GORM, godotenv).

ðŸ“Œ Deliverable: Project is initialized with a clear scope and structure.

### Set Up Database & Models

Goals:

    Design the database schema using GORM and a chosen database (SQLite or PostgreSQL).

Tasks:

    Define models for:
        Note: Fields such as ID, Title, Content, Category, MeetingDate, CreatedAt.
        Optionally, a Tag model if you decide to include tagging.
    Write migration functions to create the necessary tables.
    Seed test data to verify that the database is structured correctly.

ðŸ“Œ Deliverable: A functional database schema set up with GORM.

### Implement Backend Logic (CRUD Operations)

Goals:

    Build API endpoints for meeting note management using Gin.

Tasks:

    In routes.go, define HTTP routes:
        POST /notes to create a new note.
        GET /notes to retrieve all notes.
        GET /notes/:id to retrieve a single note.
        PUT /notes/:id to update a note.
        DELETE /notes/:id to delete a note.
    Implement handler functions that interact with your database via GORM.
    Add basic validation (e.g., non-empty title and content).

ðŸ“Œ Deliverable: Fully functional CRUD operations for meeting notes.

### Build the UI & Integrate Frontend

Goals:

    Create HTML templates using html/template and connect them with the backend.

Tasks:

    Develop HTML templates for:
        Dashboard: Display a list of meeting notes, with search and filtering options.
        Note Detail Page: Show detailed information for a selected note.
        Form Pages: For adding/editing meeting notes.
    Incorporate basic CSS styling to create a clean, responsive UI.
    Connect the templates to your backend so data is rendered dynamically.

ðŸ“Œ Deliverable: A functional UI that displays meeting notes and allows for basic interactions.

### Implement Search & Filtering Functionality

Goals:

    Enhance user experience by enabling search and filtering for meeting notes.

Tasks:

    Add a search feature to filter notes by keywords or category.
    Update the dashboard UI to include search results.
    Ensure that the backend handles filtering queries efficiently.
    Test the search functionality with various inputs.

ðŸ“Œ Deliverable: Users can search and filter meeting notes in real time.

### Testing, Debugging & Final UI Enhancements

Goals:

    Thoroughly test the full application.
    Fix any bugs and polish the UI/UX.

Tasks:

    Manually test all CRUD operations, search/filter functionality, and page responsiveness.
    Debug issues with API endpoints and UI rendering.
    Refine error messages and validations.
    Optimize any slow database queries if necessary.

ðŸ“Œ Deliverable: A bug-free, polished Meeting Notes Manager with a smooth user experience.

### Final Testing, Documentation & Deployment

Goals:

    Perform final end-to-end testing.
    Document the project and deploy it using a platform like Heroku or Railway.

Tasks:

    Conduct comprehensive testing of all features.
    Write or update documentation (README, API documentation, deployment instructions).
    Set up environment variables using godotenv.
    Deploy the app to a hosting platform.
    Record a demo video or capture screenshots for content creation.

ðŸ“Œ Deliverable: The Meeting Notes Manager is live, fully documented, and ready for your portfolio and social media.
